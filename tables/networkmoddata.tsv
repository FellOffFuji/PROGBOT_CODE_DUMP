Name	Description
AnonyMode	All Navi identities are hidden. Everyone has a generic appearance and voice. Attempts to expose users’ identities is a bannable offense.
ChatLog	All spoken and written dialogue is recorded, including the timestamp, speaker’s identity, and information about their connection.
CloudbankPolling	All Navis periodically get to vote on aesthetic details, like the sky’s color, the weather, and the presence of birdsong. Navis can pay 1000z to instantly toggle a vote on one topic.
CommFilter	Nobody can speak. Any form of text is erased. Navis can only communicate via body language, facial expression, and an array of server-approved emoji.
ContinueFunction	When Navis are reduced to 0 HP, they can heal back up to half HP (rounded down) by paying 2000z. Restoration takes a minute.
EjectTimer	Navis are forced to jack out after being inside for one hour. Independent Navis are automatically deleted after an hour.
HoloNet	Holograms display the server’s contents in the real world. Navis see the world around their holograms as if they were standing in the real world.
Instanced	The server generates a new copy of the area for each Navi. Each copy is separate from the others, preventing Navis from interacting with other areas and Navis.
Labyrinth	The layout of the server periodically shuffles. Every door leads to a different room, every hallway turns differently, and every warp point leads somewhere else.
OutdatedEngine	Failed rolls can cause glitches, like getting stuck in the floor or corrupting a Near object. It may be possible to exploit the server’s buggy code to end up in strange/hidden places.
SkullBrand	Any Navi that damages a target is branded as Hostile for a week. Brands are visible from Near range.
WikiDecor	Any Navi marked “trusted” can make a Coding roll to add to or modify the server’s contents. Adding or modifying decor is Easy, and adding or modifying new rooms is Hard.
