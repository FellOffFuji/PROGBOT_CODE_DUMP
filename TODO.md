- `>rule` command
- Add MegaCheer as query
 -Required documents check: should add '.txt' to settings.py

### New Features
- Roll random adventures from the book
- Shop/economy guidance
- Secret Nyx link command (>nyx) [wartorn: will add `>nyx` alias later]
- query and similar commands really should have some simple stuff like boolean joins.
- Chip or queries: simple+guard, support+guard
- Notion support

### Potential Ideas
- Add NaviChip creation rules
- Shop ideas for new GMs?
- General `repeat` command? (Element, Mysterydata, roll)
- Training GPT-2 on how to add a man with a gun to any scene
