parry	parrying, parrythisyoufuckingcasual	FALSE		A character can try to counter a melee attack with a melee attack of their own, called a **__parry__**. Both parties roll using the appropriate skill, likely Strength. Whoever has the most hits wins, and the loser takes damage equal to the winner’s roll. This damage is not reduced by how many hits the loser rolled.\n\nIf the two characters tie, they have a choice: back out or escalate. Both parties should declare this simultaneously. If both back out, nobody takes damage and the parry ends. If one escalates and the other backs out, the parry ends and the one that backed out is the loser. If both parties escalate, roll to melee attack each other again. Whoever rolls higher is the winner, unless they tie; in which case, the cycle continues until someone comes out on top. \n\nUnless both back out, when the parry ends, the loser takes damage equal to the winner’s strongest attack. However, if the loser backed out, they take half the damage they normally would, rounded up.
talents	talent	FALSE		NetOps have __**Talents**__: one for Kids, two for Teens, and three for Adults. Talents can be any area of expertise or interest. They should be general enough that they could organically come up (e.g. “Theater,” not “Ancient Opera”), but not so general that they apply more often than they don’t (e.g. “Judo,” not “Fighting”).\n**Once per session**, a NetOp can turn a failure/partial success into a full success if it falls under their Talent. **__This only applies to NetOp rolls.__**
hazard	hazards	FALSE		**__Hazards__** are environmental challenges that players might encounter, such as stepping across burning coals, breathing in clouds of poison gas, or being crushed by a boulder. GMs can reduce a Hazard's effects in exchange for another negative effect (e.g. upshifting rolls, setting off an alarm, briefly freezing a Navi in place). Players may suggest alternate ways of resisting hazards (e.g. Speed instead of Stamina). Lastly, normal upshifting/downshifting rules apply; some Hazards may be Easy to defend by default, or naturally Hard to resist. **Treat these hazard descriptions as flexible suggestions.**\n\nFor a list of hazard examples from the rulebook, type `{cp}help hazardex`!
hazardex	hazardexample, hazardexamples,  hazardsexamples, hazardsex	TRUE		**Light hazards:** Perform a Normal Stamina roll. On a failure, take 2 damage. On a partial success, take 1.\n**Normal hazards:** Perform a Normal Stamina roll. On a failure, take 4 damage. On a partial success, take 2.\n**Extreme hazards:** Perform a Normal Stamina roll. On a failure, take 6 damage. On a partial, take 4. On a full success, take 2.\n\n**Distractions:** Perform an Easy Bravery roll. On a failure, upshift the next two Mind rolls. On a partial success, upshift the next Mind roll. Penalties will fade if you take time to rest and recollect yourself.\n**Panics:** Perform a Normal Bravery roll. On a failure, upshift the next two rolls. On a partial success, upshift the next roll. Penalties will fade if you get away from the source of the panic, take time to rest, and recollect yourself.\n**Freezes:** Perform a Hard Bravery roll. On a failure, you freeze for several seconds, too panicked to act. On a partial success, you hesitate for just a moment.
download	virusdownload, chipdata	FALSE		After deleting a Virus, a Navi may attempt to capture its attack data. The amount of data available to download depends on three factors:\n> • The Navi began to process the Virus immediately after deletion.\n> • The Virus was deleted quickly.\n> • The Virus did minimal damage.\nIf none are true, there will not be enough data to piece together anything usable.\n\nFor **__NetOp/Navi pairs__**, the Navi may attempt to send data to a Blank BattleChip by rolling **Navi Coding**. The difficulty of the roll depends on the criteria above: if all three factors hold true, the roll is Easy; if two, Normal; and only one, Hard. Outside circumstances may make the roll more difficult (e.g. trying to write to a Blank BattleChip while in active combat.)\n\nOn a partial success, the BattleChip may not be the data you were looking for (Zenny, a different BattleChip). On a success, the Blank BattleChip contains the desired attack or data. On a critical success, the Navi may get extra data with the BattleChip, or they may be able to use it instantly.\n\nFor** __Independent Navis__**, because they cannot use Blank BattleChips, they don’t roll to download Virus attack data. Instead, they always get a chip on deletion, with the number of uses equal to the number of difficulty critera met.
hotspot	hotspots	FALSE		**__Hotspots__** are landmarks containing power, ranging from symbolic statues to mysterious effigies and glowing fissures. All Hotspots have a **power rating** from 3 to 9. Navis can draw upon Hotspots by making physical contact for a minute. Afterwards, they can reduce the Hotspot’s power rating by one to pick an effect:\n> • Get all rest benefits instantly\n> • Get +3 EB until next rest (doesn't stack)\n> • Add +2 to 2 skills until next rest or Hotspot use\n> • Set a BattleChip’s uses to 3 (MegaChips incompatible)\nAfter a Hotspot’s power is reduced, it may take days or weeks to recover. Increasing a Hotspot’s power rating requires a high concentration of complex expressive data in its vicinity - in other words, strong expressions of emotion. The more Navis, energy, and strong emotions are involved, the more power is added.
chipruling		TRUE		__**BattleChips**__ are one-use attacks that NetOps slot into their PETs.\nYour PET's folder space is determined by your **Navi Mind + Navi Info + 2**.\nWhen making a new character, pick starter BattleChips equal to your **NetOp Mind + NetOp Info + 2**.\n\nAfter a Navi uses a BattleChip, they need to jack out to make that BattleChip usable again, or to change your BattleChip folder. **By default, Folders may not have duplicate BattleChips or more than 1 MegaChip, unless explictly stated otherwise.**
ncpruling		TRUE		__**Navi Customizer Programs**__ (NCPs) are installable software NetOps can use to modify their Navi! They can give various perks like increasing folder size, granting access to special Navi powers, and more!\n**Check with your GM to see how many EB (Exabytes) your character starts with!**
powerruling		TRUE		All Navis have __**Navi Powers**__: special abilities they can use at any time.\nThere are two types of powers:\n > ◊ Cost Powers reduce the relevant skill by one to use them, no roll required. Cost Powers cannot be used if the skill is 0.\n > • Roll Powers roll the relevant skill to use the power.\n\nTargets can defend against Navi Powers that directly impede them (e.g. Disruption; not Analyze). Cost Powers that only modify the user’s attack (e.g. BreakCharge) take no time to activate; other Cost Powers may be quick to activate as well, depending on the power and situation.
virusruling		TRUE		__**Viruses**__ are programs with simple, animal-like intelligences that wreak havoc across the internet. Viruses frequently work together, synergizing with different Virus types to make formidable threats. Depending on their purpose, they may modify their environment to set up traps, entrench themselves, or simply to cause as much destruction as possible.\nEach Virus has a general **Category**, which helps describe their type (i.e. Artillery Viruses firing long-range blasts), while some may have **Tags** which indicate special common properties (i.e. Hovering). Viruses use Powers just like Navis, and many have special, custom abilities!\n**All Viruses have data within them that can be downloaded upon deletion.**
bondruling		TRUE		**Bonds** are forged between NetOps and can be used for powerful **Bond Powers**! Bond Levels cannot exceed 3 and are shared. You can increase your Bond Level with someone in three ways (you can use each method once per player character):\n > • Teaching them a meaningful lesson \n > • Sacrificing something dear to you for them \n > • Reaching the end of a narrative arc with them \n\nBond Points can be spent on Bond Powers. Spend time off with a NetOp to get Bond Points equal to your Bond Level with them. (You cannot have more Bond Points than all of your Bond Levels combined.) When using a Bond Power, make sure to describe how you use your Bond with your allies! **Nothing can dispel or mitigate a Bond Power's effects.**
npuruling		TRUE		__**Navi Power Upgrades**__ (NPUs) are NCPs that can be used to upgrade Navi Powers. All NPUs require the original Navi Power, either from character creation or a NaviCust Program. **You can only have one Navi Power Upgrade installed for each Navi Power.**\nBenefits from Navi Power Upgrades are lost if either the Upgrade or the Navi Power itself are uninstalled. Anything that copies Navi Powers (e.g. NaviChips) also copies NPUs.
elementruling		TRUE		When Navis roll Affinity, they can summon or manipulate their **__element__**. Player Navis can only summon and manipulate tangible manifestations of their element. This means emotions, sensations, or abstract concepts (like Luck or Chaos) cannot be directly summoned or manipulated. However, summoned objects may be able to manipulate abstract ideas. In general, using your element becomes more difficult at greater quantities or distances.\n\nBroadly-defined elements have a harder time performing specific actions. Powerful elements should have limitations or drawbacks. Unless using the Navi Power Control, damaging Elements are Hazards.\n\n**NPCs and enemies, especially bosses, may ignore these restrictions.** Enemy elements may be overpowering or have special mechanics tied to them. Make sure to find ways to overcome the enemy's element!
audienceruling		TRUE		When a session has **__Audience Participation__**, the audience is given two resources: **Cheer Points** and **Jeer Points**. \n**Cheer Points:** When players rolls anything but a failure, they can downgrade the result of their roll to give the audience Cheer Points (+2 points per downgraded level). \n**Jeer Points:** The GM can give Jeer Points as the downside to a player's partial success or failure (2 points for partial, 4 points for failure). \n\nAudience members can spend Cheer and Jeer points at any time. If the effect can't manifest now, it will appear at the next opportunity. For larger audiences, consider limiting who can spend Cheer/Jeer points and how often! \n> **1 Point:** Roll a random effect on the Cheer/Jeer table.\n > **2 Points:** Pick a specific effect from the Cheer/Jeer table.\n > **3 Points:** Pick a specific effect from the MegaCheer/MegaJeer table! 
cheerruling		TRUE		When a session has **__Audience Participation__**, the audience is given **Cheer Points**, which they can use to grant players bonuses and benefits! \nWhen players rolls anything but a failure, they can downgrade the result of their roll to give the audience Cheer Points (+2 points per downgraded level). \n\nAudience members can spend Cheer points at any time. If the effect can't manifest now, it will appear at the next opportunity. For larger audiences, consider limiting who can spend Cheer points and how often! \n> **1 Point:** Roll a random effect on the Cheer table.\n > **2 Points:** Pick a specific effect from the Cheer table.\n > **3 Points:** Pick a specific effect from the MegaCheer table! 
jeerruling		TRUE		When a session has **__Audience Participation__**, the audience is given **Jeer Points**, which they can use to boost enemies and trip up players! \nThe GM can give Jeer Points as the downside to a player's partial success or failure (2 points for partial, 4 points for failure). \n\nAudience members can spend Jeer points at any time. If the effect can't manifest now, it will appear at the next opportunity. For larger audiences, consider limiting who can spend Cheer/Jeer points and how often! \n> **1 Point:** Roll a random effect on the Jeer table.\n > **2 Points:** Pick a specific effect from the Jeer table.\n > **3 Points:** Pick a specific effect from the MegaJeer table! 
				
kidstats	kids, kid, kidstat, kidnetop, kidnetops, netopstats, netops, netop	FALSE		**__Kid__** NetOp stats start at 2 by default. Choose one stat and set it to 1.\nNetOp skills start at 0 by default. Choose two skills and set them to 1. Choose two other skills and set them to 2.\nNetOps also start off with a **Talent**.
teenstats	teens, teen, teenstat, teennetop, teennetops	FALSE		**__Teen__** stats start at 2, except for one at 1.\nTeen skills start at 0 by default. Choose three skills and set them to 1. Choose one skill to set at 2, and one to set at 3.\nTeens also have **two Talents**.
adultstats	adult, adults, adultstat, adultnetop, adultnetops	FALSE		**__Adults__** set one stat to 1, one to 2, and one to 3.\nAdult skills start at 0 by default. Choose two skills and set them to 1. Choose two other skills and set at 2.\nAdults also have **three Talents**.
liberation	alarm, liberationmission	FALSE		During __**Liberation Missions**__, tile entrances are armed with a sensor field to detect intruders. When a player enters the field, the **__alarm__** is triggered, though they may be able to bypass the sensors using Sneakrun or a chip like Invis or Shadow. Players are unable to bring their element from a prior room; the sensor field dissipates the element.\n\n**Each alarmed tile has an alarm control panel.** If the room is cleared of threats (no remaining hostile Viruses and hazards neutralized), the alarm deactivates automatically. Some rooms may allow players to leave the room before the alarm deactivates; in that case, the alarm will not sound if everyone leaves the room, but it will not count as deactivated and will reactivate the next time the players enter.\n\nAlarms have **Countdowns** before they activate. Type `{cp}help countdown` for more details.\n\nThe base types of locks are **Lockboxes**, **CryptoLocks**, **ProgLocks**, **SyncLocks**, and **StealthLocks**. Type `{cp}help [lock]` (i.e. `{cp}help lockbox`) for more details.
countdown	countdowns	FALSE		There is a brief period between the alarm being triggered and its activation called the **__Countdown__**. **Every time a player rolls or uses a (non-Simple) BattleChip, the Countdown timer lowers by 1.** Parrying and defending against an attack does not lower the Countdown timer. When the timer hits 0, the alarm sounds, which triggers one or more repercussions.
perfectliberation	perfectlib	FALSE		If the tile is cleared with each player reducing the Countdown timer by one or less, the players get a **Perfect Liberation.** After the mission is complete, the GM gives the players a reward based on the number of Perfect Liberations they achieved.
lockbox	lockboxes	TRUE		__**Lockboxes**__ are encased in a hard shell that requires force to break. Once the shell is gone, anyone can disable it by pressing the buttons.
cryptolock	cryptolocks	TRUE		__**CryptoLocks**__ are encrypted, unlocked by a **Normal Coding** roll.
proglock	proglocks	TRUE		__**ProgLocks**__ are special blue-colored Mr. Progs. These Progs are able to turn the alarm on and off, but they tend to have personality quirks, and are often oblivious to threats facing the system. ProgLocks can often be deactivated by charming them or helping them with a small task, though intimidation may also work. Deleting a ProgLock automatically activates the alarm and makes it impossible to disable.
synclock	synclocks	TRUE		__**SyncLocks**__ are made to ensure only human-controlled Navis pass. On activation, a series of prompts appears on the NetOp’s PET. The NetOp must succeed an **Easy Affinity** roll to sync up with their Navi and clear the prompts together. (Unusable by Independent Navis.)
stealthlock	stealthlocks	TRUE		__**StealthLocks**__ are invisible control panels. They emit a subtle audio signal (e.g. beeping; static) and can be found with a **Sense** roll, though noisy environments make that Hard. StealthLocks throw a shower of sparks when damaged, briefly revealing their position.
generator	generators	FALSE		Liberation maps may have **__Generator__** tiles. Generators create extra difficulties for nearby tiles while they’re active, and are usually tightly guarded. Generators double as the alarm control for their tiles.\n\nPlayers will have to sabotage the generator to disable them; exactly how is up to the GM. Some generators can be hacked before being disabled for a one-time benefit.\n\nFor help on specific generators, try asking for it specifically! (i.e. `{cp}help amplifier`)
amplifier	amplifiers	TRUE		__**Amplifiers**__ are bulky machines that temporarily power up Viruses within two tiles. First, the Viruses start beeping. Next, they swell with energy, getting +2 dice to their next roll.\nWhen hacking an Amplifier, for each hit, everyone gets that many bonus dice on their next roll.
spawner	spawners	TRUE		**__Spawners__** are glowing platforms that generate specific Viruses. When players clear a tile, the Spawner creates a Virus on a Spawner-adjacent tile. Spawners can only add one Virus per tile. If all adjacent tiles have a generated Virus, the Spawner expands its range by one.\nOn hacking a Spawner, it makes a friendly Virus to help the players.
shaker	shakers	TRUE		__**Shakers**__ are huge pistons that periodically sound a siren, then slam into the ground, sending massive shockwaves to nearby tiles. The GM decides the Shaker’s range. Anyone on the ground while the shockwaves rock nearby tiles upshifts their next roll. Shakers may also make the environment gradually more dangerous with their shattering quakes.\nOn successfully hacking a Shaker, at any point, the Navi can trigger a single remote earthquake in the tile they’re in.
scanner	scanners	TRUE		**__Scanners__** are giant radars that beep, then scan nearby tiles. The GM decides their range and if their view moves clockwise or counterclockwise. When the Scanner sweeps over a tile with players, any player caught moving reduces the Countdown by 2. The sweep lasts a few moments.\nWhen hacking a Scanner, the Navi can pick a contested tile. For each hit, the player can ask the GM about the tile’s: Viruses, hazards, alarm type, or threat.
jammer	jammers	TRUE		**__Jammers__** are radio towers that enhance adjacent tiles’ alarms. In addition to the alarm’s normal effects, the Jammer fills the tile with PET-jamming signals, blocking chip usage and communication between NetOps and Navis until the alarm is deactivated.
goallock	goallocks	FALSE		__**GoalLocks**__ look like sports goals, labelled to show who owns them. They give the owner a point when something specific is put inside (e.g. a ball; a Mettaur; a cake.) If a room has only one GoalLock, it gives a point to whoever makes the goal. When the alarm triggers, the team with the most points wins.
teamlock	teamlocks	FALSE		__**TeamLocks**__ look like pressure plates, buttons, and other simple devices. TeamLocks only appear in team matches. If teams have X number of players, a tile has X number of TeamLocks. All of them must be activated simultaneously by Close Navis in order to work. The first team to work the TeamLock wins.
crownlock	crownlocks	FALSE		__**CrownLocks**__ look like large, fancy headware. Once a Navi puts it on, it shines bright. When the Navi would cause the tile’s Countdown to lower by 1, they instead gain a point. Removing the crown does not reset points. When a Navi reaches 3 points, the CrownLock activates and the Navi wins.
				
netrace	netracing, leg, legs	FALSE		During a __**NetRace**__, each Navi's vehicle uses their stats & skills, and anything that affects the vehicle also affects the Navi. Each racer also tracks their **__Velocity__**, which starts at 3 and measures their relative position to other racers. (Close: 0-2 Velocity difference; Near: 3-5 Velocity difference; Far: 6+ Velocity difference) Chips/powers that move you a range band give +/-2 Velocity, and cannot move 2 range bands. When damaged, racers can reduce either HP or Velocity. Velocity cannot go below 0. The racer that completes the final leg with the highest Velocity wins the race.\n\n Each leg follows the flowchart below:\n>>> 1. GM describes the leg and its difficulty.\n2. Players can spend 1 Velocity to roll or use a chip/power. Navi Powers can only be used once per race.\n3. Racers roll to tackle the leg, rolling at the same time and adding the number of hits to their velocity. Racers can only use each skill to overcome a leg once per race.
megavirus	megaviruses	FALSE		__**Mega Viruses**__ are Viruses with stronger abilities and more complicated powers. Due to their complex programming, Mega Viruses are **not affected** by anything that only works on Viruses (i.e. Overwrite NCP, Recall chip, certain Virus powers).\n\nAdditionally, some Mega Viruses may be controlled by **signal nodes**: powerful code clusters that issue commands from afar. Some signal nodes can be destroyed, some can be hacked, and others can simply be waited out until the node can't power the MegaVirus anymore. Once a signal node is overcome, it grants all of the Mega Virus's BattleChip drops.
signalnode	signalnodes, controlnode, controlnodes	FALSE		__**Signal Nodes**__ are powerful code clusters housed in well-protected (or well-hidden) structures that issue commands to Mega Viruses from afar. Some signal nodes can be destroyed, some can be hacked, and others can simply be waited out until the node can't power the MegaVirus anymore.\n\nOnce a signal node is overcome, it grants all of the Mega Virus's chip drops.
omegavirus	omegaviruses, omega	FALSE		__**Omega Viruses**__ are the Omega versions of Mega Viruses and are even stronger than their original form: they can have higher stats/skills, improved Powers, and extra abilities.\n\nThe same rules and restrictions for Mega Viruses apply:  Omega Viruses are **not affected** by anything that only works on Viruses, and some may be controlled by **signal nodes** from afar.\n\nAll Omega Viruses drop their **MegaChip** when overcome (unless explicitly stated otherwise) - no roll necessary.
				
darkchip	darkchips	FALSE		**__DarkChips__** are destructive BattleChips connected to an outside entity - a **Daemon**. When a Navi uses a DarkChip, they have a choice - either **increase their Daemon Bond by 1** or perform their **Tribute**.\n\nDarkChips can only be used once. DarkChips have the same restrictions as MegaChips. However, when a Daemon puts a DarkChip in a Navi’s Folder, it ignores all Folder restrictions.\n\n**Signature DarkChips** can only be accessed by that Daemon.
tribute	tributes, daemontribute, daemontributes	FALSE		**__Tributes__** are destructive acts that temporarily sacrifice a Navi’s agency, letting the Daemon act through them. Tributes have long-lasting consequences that persist on jack-out.\n\nThe primary way to Tribute is by using a DarkChip and choosing to Tribute instead of increasing your Daemon Bond by 1. However, once the Navi has a **Bond Level 3** or higher with the Daemon, the Daemon can remotely trigger their Tribute. It won’t happen instantaneously - there will be warning signs, such as a creeping feeling, icy hands, or uncontrollable shivers. When a Daemon triggers a Tribute, it is almost certain to happen at the worst possible time.
chaosunison	chaosunisons, chaosunion, chaosunions	FALSE		**__ChaosUnisons__** are corruptions of the Bond Power CrossSoul. When a Navi with a Daemon Bond activates CrossSoul, instead of spending 3 Bond Points, they can **sacrifice a DarkChip to trigger a ChaosUnison**. ChaosUnisons still Cross with an ally and contain all the benefits of a CrossSoul, but with three additional effects:\n>>> 1. Gain the Daemon's ChaosUnison benefit.\n2. CrossSoul instead lasts for **2+[Daemon Bond Leve]x2** rolls.\n3. The Navi increases their Daemon Bond Level by 1 after it ends.
domain	domains, daemondomain, daemondomains	FALSE		**__Domains__** represent the feelings the Daemon preys on and what benefits it offers. Domains influence the kinds of DarkChips Daemons provide, how they influence NetOps and Navis, and its Tribute.
daemonbond	daemonbonds	FALSE		Each __**Daemon Bond**__ Level a NetOp gains with a Daemon increases the influence the Daemon has over the Navi, with increasingly severe effects. Unlike normal Bonds, **Daemon Bonds can exceed 3**. Bond Points from Daemons can be used for normal Bond Powers. However, Navis cannot CrossSoul with Daemons.\n\nWhen a player character has a Daemon Bond, they gain an extra step to Growing Up: **Subvert your Daemon’s desire**. Completing this step can take the place of one of the other three steps. When a player character completes three Growing Up steps including “Subvert your Daemon’s desire,” the Daemon Bond Level is **reduced by one**.\n\nUse `>help daemonbondex` to see the full list of Daemon Bond effects. Unless stated otherwise, the effect of each Bond Level stacks with the following levels.
daemonbondex	daemonbondexamples, daemonbondlist, daemonbonddetails, daemonbonddetail	TRUE		**Bond Level 1:** The Daemon can freely communicate with the NetOp and Navi via the PET, using whatever form or voice they choose.\n**Bond Level 2:** When the Navi rolls partial successes during ChaosUnison, the Daemon can choose to turn them into failures or full successes. The Daemon can also subtly manipulate the NetOp’s PET.\n**Bond Level 3:** The Daemon can remotely trigger a Tribute for any reason, or no reason at all.\n**Bond Level 4:** When the Navi uses a DarkChip, the NetOp must make an Easy Affinity roll to prevent the Daemon from taking control of the Navi.\n**Bond Level 5:** The Navi can ChaosUnison directly with the Daemon, adding 4 to every skill. DarkChip use now requires a Normal NetOp Affinity roll to prevent the Daemon from controlling the Navi.\n**Bond Level 6+:** The NetOp must make a Hard Affinity roll on jack-out, DarkChip use, and when a target is deleted. Failing this roll means the Daemon assumes total control of the Navi, likely permanently.
