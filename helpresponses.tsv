chip	chips	BattleChips are one-use attacks that NetOps slot into their PETs.\nYour PET's folder space is determined by your **Navi's Mind + Navi's Info + 2**.\nWhen making a new character, pick starter BattleChips equal to your **NetOp's Mind + NetOp's Info + 2**.\n\nAfter a Navi uses a BattleChip, they need to jack out to make that BattleChip usable again, or to change your BattleChip folder. **Folders often may not have duplicate BattleChips, or more than 1 MegaChip.**\n\nThis command can display info on BattleChips. It can also search for all BattleChips from a specific category, with a specific tag, Crossover Content source, or in a specific license.
ncp		NCPs (Or Navi Customizer Programs) are installable software NetOps can use to modify their Navi! They can give various perks like increasing folder size, granting access to special Navi powers, and more!\n**Check with your GM to see how many EB (Exabytes) your character starts with!**\n\nThis command can display NCPs.
power	powers	All Navis have Navi Powers: special abilities they can use whenever they like.\nThere are two types: Cost and Roll powers.\n**    - Cost powers reduce the listed skill by 1 until jack out and __do not affect liberation mission alarm countdowns__.\n    - Roll powers roll the associated skill to use the power.**\n\nThis command can display Navi and Virus powers (Cost, Roll, and Passive). It can also search powers by type, such as Navi Sense/Cost and Virus Passive. Type `{cp}power` to learn more!
virus		Viruses are programs with simple, animal-like intelligences that wreak havoc across the internet. With lots of different shapes and sizes, some are more dangerous than others. Viruses use powers just like navis, and some even have special passive abilities!\n**All viruses have data within them that can be downloaded into a Blank Chip upon deletion.**\n\nThis command can pull up a basic Virus description.
virusx		This specific command pulls up full stats for viruses, like stats and drops. __This command is more for GMs rather than players in a session.__
tag		Viruses and Battlechips have tags that determine how they behave or work in battle.\n\nThis command displays tags for various things.

upgrade	npu	Looks up all upgrades for a default Navi Power!
crimsonnoise		This commands rolls CrimsonNoise (unofficial content) and gives you the result automatically!
element		When Navis roll Affinity, they can summon or manipulate their **__element__**. Player Navis can only summon and manipulate tangible manifestations of their element. This means emotions, sensations, or abstract concepts (like Luck or Chaos) cannot be directly summoned or manipulated. However, summoned objects may be able to manipulate abstract ideas. In general, using your element becomes more difficult at greater quantities or distances.\n\nBroadly-defined elements have a harder time performing specific actions. Powerful elements should have limitations or drawbacks. Unless using the Navi Power Control, damaging Elements are Hazards.\n\n**NPCs and enemies, especially bosses, may ignore these restrictions.** Enemy elements may be overpowering or have special mechanics tied to them. Make sure to find ways to overcome the enemy's element!\n\nThis command rolls random elements from the Element Generation table. Type `{cp}element` for more details.

invite		Creates an invite link to add ProgBot to other servers.
		
battlechip	battlechips	BattleChips are one-use attacks that NetOps slot into their PETs.\nYour PET's folder space is determined by your **Navi's Mind + Navi's Info + 2**.\nWhen making a new character, pick starter BattleChips equal to your **NetOp's Mind + NetOp's Info + 2**.\n\nAfter a Navi uses a BattleChip, they need to jack out to make that BattleChip usable again, or to change your BattleChip folder. **Folders often may not have duplicate BattleChips, or more than 1 MegaChip.**

parry	parrying, parry this you fucking casual	A character can try to counter a melee attack with a melee attack of their own, called a **__parry__**. Both parties roll using the appropriate skill, likely Strength. Whoever has the most hits wins, and the loser takes damage equal to the winner’s roll. This damage is not reduced by how many hits the loser rolled.\n\nIf the two characters tie, they have a choice: back out or escalate. Both parties should declare this simultaneously. If both back out, nobody takes damage and the parry ends. If one escalates and the other backs out, the parry ends and the one that backed out is the loser. If both parties escalate, roll to melee attack each other again. Whoever rolls higher is the winner, unless they tie; in which case, the cycle continues until someone comes out on top. \n\nUnless both back out, when the parry ends, the loser takes damage equal to the winner’s strongest attack. However, if the loser backed out, they take half the damage they normally would, rounded up.
talents	talent	NetOps often get one Talent. Talents can be any area of expertise or interest. They should be general enough that they could organically come up (e.g. “Theater,” not “Ancient Opera”), but not so general that they apply more often than they don’t (e.g. “Judo,” not “Fighting”).\n**Once per session, a NetOp can turn a failure/partial success into a success if it falls under their Talent. __This only applies to NetOp rolls.__**
hazard	hazards	**__Hazards__** are environmental challenges that players might encounter, such as stepping across burning coals, breathing in clouds of poison gas, or being crushed by a boulder. GMs can reduce a Hazard's effects in exchange for another negative effect (e.g. upshifting rolls, setting off an alarm, briefly freezing a Navi in place). Players may suggest alternate ways of resisting hazards (e.g. Speed instead of Stamina). Lastly, normal upshifting/downshifting rules apply; some Hazards may be Easy to defend by default, or naturally Hard to resist. **Treat these hazard descriptions as flexible suggestions.**\n\nFor a list of hazard examples from the rulebook, type `{cp}help hazardex`!
hazardex	hazardexample, hazardexamples, hazardsex, hazardsexamples	**Light hazards:** Perform a Normal Stamina roll. On a failure, take 2 damage. On a partial success, take 1.\n**Normal hazards:** Perform a Normal Stamina roll. On a failure, take 4 damage. On a partial success, take 2.\n**Extreme hazards:** Perform a Normal Stamina roll. On a failure, take 6 damage. On a partial, take 4. On a full success, take 2.\n\n**Distractions:** Perform an Easy Bravery roll. On a failure, upshift the next two Mind rolls. On a partial success, upshift the next Mind roll. Penalties will fade if you take time to rest and recollect yourself.\n**Panics:** Perform a Normal Bravery roll. On a failure, upshift the next two rolls. On a partial success, upshift the next roll. Penalties will fade if you get away from the source of the panic, take time to rest, and recollect yourself.\n**Freezes:** Perform a Hard Bravery roll. On a failure, you freeze for several seconds, too panicked to act. On a partial success, you hesitate for just a moment.
		
alarm		During Liberation Missions, tile entrances are armed with a sensor field to detect intruders. When a player enters the field, the **__alarm__** is triggered, though they may be able to bypass the sensors using Sneakrun or a chip like Invis or Shadow. Players are unable to bring their element from a prior room; the sensor field dissipates the element.\n\n**Each alarmed tile has an alarm control panel.** If the room is cleared of threats (no remaining hostile Viruses and hazards neutralized), the alarm deactivates automatically. Some rooms may allow players to leave the room before the alarm deactivates; in that case, the alarm will not sound if everyone leaves the room, but it will not count as deactivated and will reactivate the next time the players enter.\n\nAlarms have **Countdowns** before they activate. Type `{cp}countdown` for more details.\n\nThe base types of locks are **Lockboxes**, **CryptoLocks**, **ProgLocks**, **SyncLocks**, and **StealthLocks**. Type `{cp}help [lock]` (i.e. `{cp}help lockbox`) for more details.
countdown		There is a brief period between the alarm being triggered and its activation called the **__Countdown__**. **Every time a player rolls or uses a (non-Simple) BattleChip, the Countdown timer lowers by 1.** Parrying and defending against an attack does not lower the Countdown timer. When the timer hits 0, the alarm sounds, which triggers one or more repercussions.
perfectliberation	perfectlib	If the tile is cleared with each player reducing the Countdown timer by one or less, the players get a **Perfect Liberation.** After the mission is complete, the GM gives the players a reward based on the number of Perfect Liberations they achieved.
lockbox	lockboxes	**Lockboxes** are protected by a hard outer shell which can be destroyed with force. Once the outer shell is destroyed, anyone can turn off the alarm by pressing the buttons.
cryptolock	cryptolocks	**CryptoLocks** are encrypted control panels. A Normal Coding roll is enough to unlock them.
proglock	proglocks	**ProgLocks** are special blue-colored Mr. Progs. These Progs are able to turn the alarm on and off, but they tend to have personality quirks, and are often oblivious to threats facing the system. ProgLocks can often be deactivated by charming them or helping them with a small task, though intimidation may also work. Deleting a ProgLock automatically activates the alarm and makes it impossible to disable.
synclock	synclocks	**SyncLocks** are made to ensure only human-controlled Navis can pass through. When activated, a series of prompts appears on the NetOp’s PET. The NetOp must succeed on an Easy Affinity roll to sync up with their Navi and clear the prompts simultaneously. (Unusable by Independent Navis.)
stealthlock	stealthlocks	**StealthLocks** are invisible control panels. They emit a subtle audio signal (e.g. intermittent beeping, a static whine) and can be detected with a Sense roll, though finding them in a noisy environment will be Hard. StealthLocks throw a shower of sparks when damaged, briefly revealing their position.
download	virusdownload	After deleting a Virus, a Navi may attempt to capture its attack data. The amount of data available to download depends on three factors:\n> • The Navi began to process the Virus immediately after deletion.\n> • The Virus was deleted quickly.\n> • The Virus did minimal damage.\nIf none are true, there will not be enough data to piece together anything usable.\n\nFor **__NetOp/Navi pairs__**, the Navi may attempt to send data to a Blank BattleChip by rolling **Navi Coding**. The difficulty of the roll depends on the criteria above: if all three factors hold true, the roll is Easy; if two, Normal; and only one, Hard. Outside circumstances may make the roll more difficult (e.g. trying to write to a Blank BattleChip while in active combat.)\n\nOn a partial success, the BattleChip may not be the data you were looking for (Zenny, a different BattleChip). On a success, the Blank BattleChip contains the desired attack or data. On a critical success, the Navi may get extra data with the BattleChip, or they may be able to use it instantly.\n\nFor** __Independent Navis__**, because they cannot use Blank BattleChips, they don’t roll to download Virus attack data. Instead, they always get a chip on deletion, with the number of uses equal to the number of difficulty critera met.
		
netrace	netracing, net race, net racing, leg, legs	During a __**NetRace**__, each Navi's vehicle uses their stats & skills, and anything that affects the vehicle also affects the Navi. Each racer also tracks their **__Velocity__**, which measures their relative position to other racers. (Close: 0-2 Velocity difference; Near: 3-5 Velocity difference; Far: 6+ Velocity difference) When damaged, racers can reduce either HP or Velocity. Velocity cannot go below 0. The racer that completes the final leg with the highest Velocity wins the race.\n\n Each leg follows the flowchart below:\n>>> 1. **GM describes the leg** and its difficulty.\n2. **Players can spend 1 Velocity to roll or use a chip/power.** Navi Powers can only be used once per race.\n3. **Racers roll to tackle the leg**, rolling at the same time and adding the number of hits to their velocity. Racers can only use each skill to overcome a leg once per race.
darkchip	darkchips	**__DarkChips__** are destructive BattleChips connected to an outside entity - a **Daemon**. When a Navi uses a DarkChip, they have a choice - either **increase their Daemon Bond by 1** or perform their **Tribute**.\n\nDarkChips can only be used once. DarkChips have the same restrictions as MegaChips. However, when a Daemon puts a DarkChip in a Navi’s Folder, it ignores all Folder restrictions.\n\n**Signature DarkChips** can only be accessed by that Daemon.
tribute	tributes	**__Tributes__** are destructive acts that temporarily sacrifice a Navi’s agency, letting the Daemon act through them. Tributes have long-lasting consequences that persist on jack-out.\n\nThe primary way to Tribute is by using a DarkChip and choosing to Tribute instead of increasing your Daemon Bond by 1. However, once the Navi has a **Bond Level 3** or higher with the Daemon, the Daemon can remotely trigger their Tribute. It won’t happen instantaneously - there will be warning signs, such as a creeping feeling, icy hands, or uncontrollable shivers. When a Daemon triggers a Tribute, it is almost certain to happen at the worst possible time.
chaosunison	chaosunisons, chaosunion, chaosunions	**__ChaosUnisons__** are corruptions of the Bond Power CrossSoul. When a Navi with a Daemon Bond activates CrossSoul, instead of spending 3 Bond Points, they can **sacrifice a DarkChip to trigger a ChaosUnison**. ChaosUnisons still Cross with an ally and contain all the benefits of a CrossSoul, but with three additional effects:\n>>> 1. Gain the Daemon's ChaosUnison benefit.\n2. CrossSoul instead lasts for 2+[Daemon Bond Leve]x2 rolls.\n3. The Navi increases their Daemon Bond Level by 1 after it ends.
domain	domains	**__Domains__** represent the feelings the Daemon preys on and what benefits it offers. Domains influence the kinds of DarkChips Daemons provide, how they influence NetOps and Navis, and its Tribute.
daemonbondex	daemonbondexamples, daemonbondlist, daemonbonddetails, daemon bond details, daemonbond details, daemonbonddetail, daemon bond detail, daemonbond detail	**Bond Level 1:** The Daemon can freely communicate with the NetOp and Navi via the PET, using whatever form or voice they choose.\n\n**Bond Level 2:** When the Navi rolls partial successes during ChaosUnison, the Daemon can choose to turn them into failures or full successes. The Daemon can also subtly manipulate the NetOp’s PET.\n\n**Bond Level 3:** The Daemon can remotely trigger a Tribute for any reason, or no reason at all.\n\n**Bond Level 4:** When the Navi uses a DarkChip, the NetOp must make an Easy Affinity roll to prevent the Daemon from taking control of the Navi.\n\n**Bond Level 5:** The Navi can ChaosUnison directly with the Daemon, adding 4 to every skill. DarkChip use now requires a Normal NetOp Affinity roll to prevent the Daemon from controlling the Navi.\n\n**Bond Level 6+:** The NetOp must make a Hard Affinity roll on jack-out, DarkChip use, and when a target is deleted. Failing this roll means the Daemon assumes total control of the Navi, likely permanently.
daemonbond	daemon bond, daemon bonds, daemonbonds	Each Bond Level a NetOp gains with a Daemon increases the influence the Daemon has over the Navi, with increasingly severe effects. Unlike normal Bonds, **Daemon Bonds can exceed 3**. Bond Points from Daemons can be used for normal Bond Powers. However, Navis cannot CrossSoul with Daemons.\n\nWhen a player character has a Daemon Bond, they gain an extra step to Growing Up: **Subvert your Daemon’s desire**. Completing this step can take the place of one of the other three steps. When a player character completes three Growing Up steps including “Subvert your Daemon’s desire,” the Daemon Bond Level is **reduced by one**.\n\nUse `>help daemonbondex` to see the full list of Daemon Bond effects. Unless stated otherwise, the effect of each Bond Level stacks with the following levels.
