Command	Alias	Type	Hidden?	Ruling?	Response
roll	r	Rollers	FALSE		Rolls a number of X-sided dice, including success/fail thresholds or additional hits.
repeatroll	rr, repeatr	Rollers	FALSE		Repeats a roll X times. Uses the same dice algebra as `{cp}roll`.
rulebook		Lookups	FALSE		Pulls up links for the NetBattlers rulebooks.
repo	pmr, pmc, playermade	Lookups	FALSE		This command can pull up and search for player-made content on the official Notion Player-Made Repository. Type `{cp}repo` to learn more!
					
stats	skills, stat, skill	Reminders (Base)	FALSE		All characters, ranging from Navis to Viruses, have **three stats** and **nine skills**, with each stat having three related skills.\n> **Mind:** Sense, Info, Coding\n> **Body:** Strength, Speed, Stamina\n> **Soul:** Charm, Bravery, Affinity\nWhen rolling skills, the player adds the skill and the related stat, then rolls that many dice. For more information on each skill, try using `{cp}help!` (i.e. `{cp}help speed`)\n\nSkills cannot be reduced below 0. Stats cannot be reduced below 1.\n**NetOps:** Skills cannot exceed 5. Stats cannot exceed 3.\n**Navis:** Skills cannot exceed 5. Stats cannot exceed 4.
sense		Reminders (Base)	TRUE		Study your surroundings, find jack-in ports, and take aim!
info		Reminders (Base)	TRUE		Possess knowledge and expertly wield Battle Chips!
coding		Reminders (Base)	TRUE		Program, hack, and rewire things in both the real and digital worlds!
strength		Reminders (Base)	TRUE		Lift, throw, and punch objects and people!
speed		Reminders (Base)	TRUE		Run, jump, and roll places, or out of danger!
stamina		Reminders (Base)	TRUE		Endure pain and danger!
charm		Reminders (Base)	TRUE		Sweet-talk, feign innocence, and gain allies!
bravery		Reminders (Base)	TRUE		Resist fear, intimidate enemies, and inspire your allies!
affinity		Reminders (Base)	TRUE		Manipulate your Navi element, and sync your NetOp and Navi!
navicust	navicustprograms, navicustprogram, ncps	Reminders (Base)	TRUE	ncpruling	
ncp		Lookups	FALSE	ncpruling	This command can display NCPs.
growingup	growup, levelup, levelingup	Reminders (Base)	FALSE		NetOps progress over the course of an adventure, __**Growing Up**__ as they learn, make mistakes, and mature. There are two versions of the Growing Up system: **Standard** and **Lite**. Talk with your group to agree on which system to use!\n\nWhenever your NetOps grow up (as described by the progression system), **choose one skill to increase by 1**. NetOp skills cannot exceed 5. \n\n**Standard:** For roleplay enthusaists! Your NetOp grows up by completing the three steps below.\n> •  Shows weakness\n> •  Learns a hard truth\n> •  Teaches someone a meaningful lesson\nAll three steps must be completed to get a skill increase, though they can happen in any order. NetOps cannot “stack” steps; treat the steps as a checklist rather than a flowchart. For more details on the steps themselves, use `{cp}help growingupex`.\n\n**Lite:** Simple and easy! Every three sessions your NetOp finishes, your NetOp grows up. Explain what your NetOp learned.\n\n**Independent Navis** also use the Growing Up system, except instead of earning a skill point, they get +2 EB.
growingupex	growingupextra, growupex, growupextra	Reminders (Base)	FALSE		**Shows weakness:** Falling for the bad guy's lie, acting selfishly when your friends need you, or giving up when the going gets tough... Showing weakness and failing to be a hero should create a meaningful complication with lasting consequences. The reason why should be reflective of a flaw in the character. \n\n**Learns a hard truth:** Learning a hard truth means turning your big mistake into character growth with someone's help. Hard truths are lessons like “Sometimes you need to rely on other people”, “There’s always someone better than you at something”, “You don’t need to put others down to feel good about yourself” - the kinds of lessons that people need to live to learn. \n\n**Teaches someone a meaningful lesson:** To grow up, you need to help someone else in need as well. The lesson you teach someone doesn’t need to be the one you just learned, but it should be something difficult: Maybe a heart-to-heart talk about the time you thought you didn’t need anyone else, or just telling them just how much they hurt people with their recklessness. By teaching someone a meaningful lesson, you’re not just helping them; you’re also showing your own maturity and the progress you’ve made if you’ve experienced that struggle too.\n\n
bond	bondpower, bondpowers	Lookups	FALSE	bondruling	This command displays Bond Powers, along with points needed, and what they do! (Use `{cp}bond all` to see all of them!)
bondpoint	bondpoints	Reminders (Base)	TRUE	bondruling	
parry	parrying, parrythisyoufuckingcasual	Reminders (Base)	FALSE		A character can try to counter a melee attack with a melee attack of their own, called a **__parry__**. Both parties roll using the appropriate skill, likely Strength. Whoever has the most hits wins, and the loser takes damage equal to the winner’s roll. This damage is not reduced by how many hits the loser rolled. (Note: parries are affected by anything that modifies either attacking or defending.)\n\nIf the two characters tie, they have a choice: back out or escalate. Both parties should declare this simultaneously. If both back out, nobody takes damage and the parry ends. If one escalates and the other backs out, the parry ends and the one that backed out is the loser. If both parties escalate, roll to melee attack each other again. Whoever rolls higher is the winner, unless they tie; in which case, the cycle continues until someone comes out on top. \n\nUnless both back out, when the parry ends, the loser takes damage equal to the winner’s strongest attack. However, if the loser backed out, they take half the damage they normally would, rounded up. Secondary effects (e.g. stunning) do not activate until after the parry resolves.
chip	chips	Lookups	FALSE	chipruling	This command can display info on BattleChips. It can also search for all BattleChips from a specific category, with a specific tag, Crossover Content source, or in a specific license.
battlechip	battlechips	Reminders (Base)	TRUE	chipruling	
folder	chipfolder, battlechipfolder	Reminders (Base)	FALSE		Your PET's folder space is determined by your **Navi Mind + Navi Info + 2**. By default, **Folders may not have duplicate BattleChips or more than 1 MegaChip, unless explictly stated otherwise.**
tag		Lookups	FALSE		Viruses and Battlechips have __**Tags**__ and __**Categories**__ that determine how they behave or work in battle.\n\nThis command pulls up a tag or category's description.
download	virusdownload, chipdata	Reminders (Base)	FALSE		After deleting a Virus, a Navi may attempt to capture its attack data. The amount of data available to download depends on three factors:\n> • The Navi began to process the Virus immediately after deletion.\n> • The Virus was deleted quickly.\n> • The Virus did minimal damage.\nIf none are true, there will not be enough data to piece together anything usable.\n\nFor **__NetOp/Navi pairs__**, the Navi may attempt to send data to a Blank BattleChip by rolling **Navi Coding**. The difficulty of the roll depends on the criteria above: if all three factors hold true, the roll is Easy; if two, Normal; and only one, Hard. Outside circumstances may make the roll more difficult (e.g. trying to write to a Blank BattleChip while in active combat.)\n\nOn a partial success, the BattleChip may not be the data you were looking for (Zenny, a different BattleChip). On a success, the Blank BattleChip contains the desired attack or data. On a critical success, the Navi may get extra data with the BattleChip, or they may be able to use it instantly.\n\nFor** __Independent Navis__**, because they cannot use Blank BattleChips, they don’t roll to download Virus attack data. Instead, they always get a chip on deletion, with the number of uses equal to the number of difficulty critera met.
kid	kidstats, kids, kidstat, kidnetop, kidnetops, netopstats, netops, netop, child, childstats, childstat	Reminders (Base)	FALSE		**__Kid__** NetOp stats start at 2 by default. Choose one stat and set it to 1.\nNetOp skills start at 0 by default. Choose two skills and set them to 1. Choose two other skills and set them to 2.\nNetOps also start off with a **Talent**.
talents	talent	Reminders (Base)	FALSE		NetOps have __**Talents**__: one for Kids, two for Teens, and three for Adults. Talents can be any area of expertise or interest. They should be general enough that they could organically come up (e.g. “Theater,” not “Ancient Opera”), but not so general that they apply more often than they don’t (e.g. “Judo,” not “Fighting”).\n**Once per session**, a NetOp can turn a failure/partial success into a full success if it falls under their Talent. **__This only applies to NetOp rolls.__**
navi	navistats, navistat, naviskills, naviskill, startingstats	Reminders (Base)	FALSE		**__Navis__** set one stat to 1, one to 2, and one to 3.\nNavi skills start at 0 by default. Choose two skills and set them to 1. Choose two skills and set them to 2. Set another skill to 3.\nWhen creating a Navi, choose any three Navi Powers. You can use `{cp}help powers` for more details.\nFinally, pick an element for your Navi. Use `{cp}help element` for more guidance on how to pick your element.
element		Rollers	FALSE	elementruling	This command rolls random elements from the Element Generation table. Type `{cp}element` for more details.
power	powers	Lookups	FALSE	powerruling	This command can display Navi and Virus powers (Cost, Roll, and Passive). It can also search powers by type, such as Navi Sense/Cost and Virus Passive. Type `{cp}power` to learn more!
					
hazard	hazards	Reminders (Base)	FALSE		**__Hazards__** are environmental challenges that players might encounter, such as stepping across burning coals, breathing in clouds of poison gas, or being crushed by a boulder. GMs can reduce a Hazard's effects in exchange for another negative effect (e.g. upshifting rolls, setting off an alarm, briefly freezing a Navi in place). Players may suggest alternate ways of resisting hazards (e.g. Speed instead of Stamina). Lastly, normal upshifting/downshifting rules apply; some Hazards may be Easy to defend by default, or naturally Hard to resist. **Treat these hazard descriptions as flexible suggestions.**\n\nFor a list of hazard examples from the rulebook, type `{cp}help hazardex`!
hazardex	hazardexample, hazardexamples,  hazardsexamples, hazardsex	Reminders (Base)	TRUE		**Light hazards:** Perform a Normal Stamina roll. On a failure, take 2 damage. On a partial success, take 1.\n**Normal hazards:** Perform a Normal Stamina roll. On a failure, take 4 damage. On a partial success, take 2.\n**Extreme hazards:** Perform a Normal Stamina roll. On a failure, take 6 damage. On a partial, take 4. On a full success, take 2.\n\n**Distractions:** Perform an Easy Bravery roll. On a failure, upshift the next two Mind rolls. On a partial success, upshift the next Mind roll. Penalties will fade if you take time to rest and recollect yourself.\n**Panics:** Perform a Normal Bravery roll. On a failure, upshift the next two rolls. On a partial success, upshift the next roll. Penalties will fade if you get away from the source of the panic, take time to rest, and recollect yourself.\n**Freezes:** Perform a Hard Bravery roll. On a failure, you freeze for several seconds, too panicked to act. On a partial success, you hesitate for just a moment.
independent	indies, independentnavis, indienavis, independents, indie	Reminders (Base)	FALSE		__**Independent Navis**__ are Navis that function alone, with no NetOp to assist them.\n\nAs they are always online and never jack out, they can **rest to restore their HP, spent skills/stats, and reconfigure their NaviCust.** While resting, Navis are completely inert. If a Navi is forced to act immediately after resting, they upshift their first three rolls.\n\nInstead of preparing Folders and slotting chips in, Independent Navis carry chip uses, which range from 0 to 3, in their Folder at all times. They cannot hold more chips than their Folder size. Using a chip decrements the remaining number of uses; zero-use chips are unusable but still take Folder space, and disappear when removed from a Folder. **Independent Navis get a number of starting chips equal to their Folder size, each with two uses.**\n\n**Independent Navis have their own version of the Growing Up system**. Instead of earning skill points, they get +2 EB. They also use the Bond system, though StandTogether uses [Navi Soul + Navi Bravery] instead of [NetOp Bravery + Navi Bravery] and FullSynchro is unusable. \n\nFor more details on **Advanced Rulings** for Independent Navis, use `{cp}help independent adv`! If you're not sure how a chip or NCP translates to Independent Navis, try checking those rules!
independentadv	indieadv, indiesadv, indieadvanced, indiesadvanced, indienaviadv, indienavisadv, indienaviadvanced, indienavisadvanced, independentadvanced, independentsadv, independentsadvanced, independentnaviadv, independentnavisadv, independentnaviadvanced, independentnavisadvanced	Reminders (Base)	FALSE		For **__Independent Navis__**, anything that requires sacrificing a **chip** sacrifices a charge instead. Any **NCP** that activates on jack-in instead activates after rest or drawing on a Hotspot. \n\nAnything that disrupts the link between Navi and **PET** instead jams their Folder; if something otherwise affects or depends on the PET, it instead affects/depends on the last used Hotspot. \n\nLastly, two Navi Power change for Independent Navis: **Reconfig** instantly trades BattleChips with a Near ally, and **Refresh** adds +2 to the user’s Folder size until rest. You can query them with ProgBot using `{cp}power ReconfigIndie` and `{cp}power RefreshIndie`.
hotspot	hotspots	Reminders (Base)	FALSE		**__Hotspots__** are landmarks containing power, ranging from symbolic statues to mysterious effigies and glowing fissures. All Hotspots have a **power rating** from 3 to 9. Navis can draw upon Hotspots by making physical contact for a minute. Afterwards, they can reduce the Hotspot’s power rating by one to pick an effect:\n> • Get all rest benefits instantly\n> • Get +3 EB until next rest (doesn't stack)\n> • Add +2 to 2 skills until next rest or Hotspot use\n> • Set a BattleChip’s uses to 3 (MegaChips incompatible)\nAfter a Hotspot’s power is reduced, it may take days or weeks to recover. Increasing a Hotspot’s power rating requires a high concentration of complex expressive data in its vicinity - in other words, strong expressions of emotion. The more Navis, energy, and strong emotions are involved, the more power is added.
virus		Lookups	FALSE	virusruling	This command can pull up a basic Virus description.
virusx		Lookups	FALSE		This specific command pulls up full stats for viruses, like stats and drops. __This command is more for GMs rather than players in a session.__
virusr	virusrandom	Rollers	FALSE		Rolls random Viruses. You can also give me specific categories to roll Viruses from; check out `{cp}virusr` for more details!
mysterydata		Rollers	FALSE		This command rolls Mystery Data and gives you the result automatically! Specify `{cp}mysterydata common`, `{cp}mysterydata uncommon`, or `{cp}mysterydata rare`!
mysteryreward		Rollers	FALSE		This command rolls Mystery Data (BattleChips and NCPs only) and gives you the result automatically! Specify `{cp}mysteryreward common`, `{cp}mysteryreward uncommon`, or `{cp}mysteryreward rare`!
					
teen	teens, teen, teenstat, teenstats, teennetop, teennetops	Reminders (Advanced Content)	FALSE		**__Teen__** stats start at 2, except for one at 1.\nTeen skills start at 0 by default. Choose three skills and set them to 1. Choose one skill to set at 2, and one to set at 3.\nTeens also have **two Talents**.
adult	adult, adults, adultstat, adultstats, adultnetop, adultnetops	Reminders (Advanced Content)	FALSE		**__Adults__** set one stat to 1, one to 2, and one to 3.\nAdult skills start at 0 by default. Choose two skills and set them to 1. Choose two other skills and set at 2.\nAdults also have **three Talents**.
license	s-license, b-license, c-license, a-license, licenses	Reminders (Advanced Content)	FALSE		Experienced NetBattlers can start off with **__NetBattling Licenses__**, indicating their level of experience and power. There are three License ranks in the book: **C**, **A**, and **S-License**.\n\n **C-License:** *Experienced NetBattlers - best in the city*\n> Start with a NaviCust and **6EB** of space. You can have **one** Personal BattleChip. Pick from the base and C-License pools for your starting chips, as well as 4EB worth of NCPs to start out with.\n\n**A-License:** *Top-Tier NetBattlers - best in the nation*\n> Start with a NaviCust and **10EB** of space. You can have **two** Personal BattleChips. Pick from the base, C-License, and A-License pools for your starting chips, as well as 6EB worth of NCPs to start out with.\n\n**S-License:** *Legendary NetBattlers - best in the world*\n> Start with a NaviCust and **15EB** of space. You can have **three** Personal BattleChips. Pick from the base, C-License, A-License, and S-License pools for your starting chips, as well as 10EB worth of NCPs to start out with.
personalchips	personalchip, personalbattlechips, personalbattlechip	Reminders (Advanced Content)	FALSE		When creating new characters, especially if they are starting off with Licenses, GMs may allow NetOps to get __**Personal BattleChips**__ when choosing starting chips.\n\nWhen the player chooses a Personal BattleChip, they pick any normal BattleChip that fits thematically with their NetOp/Navi, including whatever Crossover Content the GM allows. (i.e. PaladinSword for a medieval-style Navi, or Timpani for a drummer NetOp.) **The GM always gets the final say as to whether a BattleChip can be taken as a Personal BattleChip.** Personal Battlechips count towards the normal starting chip limit.
liberation	alarm, liberationmission	Reminders (Liberation)	FALSE		During __**Liberation Missions**__, tile entrances are armed with a sensor field to detect intruders. When a player enters the field, the **__alarm__** is triggered, though they may be able to bypass the sensors using Sneakrun or a chip like Invis or Shadow. Players are unable to bring their element from a prior room; the sensor field dissipates the element.\n\n**Each alarmed tile has an alarm control panel.** If the room is cleared of threats (no remaining hostile Viruses and hazards neutralized), the alarm deactivates automatically. Some rooms may allow players to leave the room before the alarm deactivates; in that case, the alarm will not sound if everyone leaves the room, but it will not count as deactivated and will reactivate the next time the players enter.\n\nAlarms have **Countdowns** before they activate. Type `{cp}help countdown` for more details.\n\nThe base types of locks are **Lockboxes**, **CryptoLocks**, **ProgLocks**, **SyncLocks**, and **StealthLocks**. Type `{cp}help [lock]` (i.e. `{cp}help lockbox`) for more details.
countdown	countdowns	Reminders (Liberation)	FALSE		There is a brief period between the alarm being triggered and its activation called the **__Countdown__**. During the Countdown, the GM gives the players a timer number, with lower numbers being more severe.** Every time a player rolls or uses a (non-Simple) BattleChip, the Countdown timer lowers by 1.** Parrying and defending against an attack does not lower the Countdown timer. When the timer hits 0, the alarm sounds, which triggers one or more repercussions.
perfectliberation	perfectlib	Reminders (Liberation)	FALSE		If the tile is cleared with each player reducing the Countdown timer by one or less, the players get a **Perfect Liberation.** After the mission is complete, the GM may give the players a reward based on the number of Perfect Liberations they achieved.
lockbox	lockboxes	Reminders (Liberation)	TRUE		__**Lockboxes**__ are encased in a hard shell that requires force to break. Once the shell is gone, anyone can disable it by pressing the buttons.
cryptolock	cryptolocks	Reminders (Liberation)	TRUE		__**CryptoLocks**__ are encrypted, unlocked by a **Normal Coding** roll.
proglock	proglocks	Reminders (Liberation)	TRUE		__**ProgLocks**__ are special blue-colored Mr. Progs. These Progs are able to turn the alarm on and off, but they tend to have personality quirks, and are often oblivious to threats facing the system. ProgLocks can often be deactivated by charming them or helping them with a small task, though intimidation may also work. Deleting a ProgLock automatically activates the alarm and makes it impossible to disable.
synclock	synclocks	Reminders (Liberation)	TRUE		__**SyncLocks**__ are made to ensure only human-controlled Navis pass. On activation, a series of prompts appears on the NetOp’s PET. The NetOp must succeed an **Easy Affinity** roll to sync up with their Navi and clear the prompts together. (Unusable by Independent Navis.)
stealthlock	stealthlocks	Reminders (Liberation)	TRUE		__**StealthLocks**__ are invisible control panels. They emit a subtle audio signal (e.g. beeping; static) and can be found with a **Sense** roll, though noisy environments make that Hard. StealthLocks throw a shower of sparks when damaged, briefly revealing their position.
generator	generators	Reminders (Liberation)	FALSE		Liberation maps may have **__Generator__** tiles. Generators create extra difficulties for nearby tiles while they’re active, and are usually tightly guarded. Generators double as the alarm control for their tiles.\n\nPlayers will have to sabotage the generator to disable them; exactly how is up to the GM. Some generators can be hacked before being disabled for a one-time benefit.\n\nFor help on specific generators, try asking for it specifically! (i.e. `{cp}help amplifier`)
amplifier	amplifiers	Reminders (Liberation)	TRUE		__**Amplifiers**__ are bulky machines that temporarily power up Viruses within two tiles. First, the Viruses start beeping. Next, they swell with energy, getting +2 dice to their next roll.\nWhen hacking an Amplifier, for each hit, everyone gets that many bonus dice on their next roll.
spawner	spawners	Reminders (Liberation)	TRUE		**__Spawners__** are glowing platforms that generate specific Viruses. When players clear a tile, the Spawner creates a Virus on a Spawner-adjacent tile. Spawners can only add one Virus per tile. If all adjacent tiles have a generated Virus, the Spawner expands its range by one.\nOn hacking a Spawner, it makes a friendly Virus to help the players.
shaker	shakers	Reminders (Liberation)	TRUE		__**Shakers**__ are huge pistons that periodically sound a siren, then slam into the ground, sending massive shockwaves to nearby tiles. The GM decides the Shaker’s range. Anyone on the ground while the shockwaves rock nearby tiles upshifts their next roll. Shakers may also make the environment gradually more dangerous with their shattering quakes.\nOn successfully hacking a Shaker, at any point, the Navi can trigger a single remote earthquake in the tile they’re in.
scanner	scanners	Reminders (Liberation)	TRUE		**__Scanners__** are giant radars that beep, then scan nearby tiles. The GM decides their range and if their view moves clockwise or counterclockwise. When the Scanner sweeps over a tile with players, any player caught moving reduces the Countdown by 2. The sweep lasts a few moments.\nWhen hacking a Scanner, the Navi can pick a contested tile. For each hit, the player can ask the GM about the tile’s: Viruses, hazards, alarm type, or threat.
jammer	jammers	Reminders (Liberation)	TRUE		**__Jammers__** are radio towers that enhance adjacent tiles’ alarms. In addition to the alarm’s normal effects, the Jammer fills the tile with PET-jamming signals, blocking chip usage and communication between NetOps and Navis until the alarm is deactivated.
audience	audienceparticipation	Rollers	FALSE	audienceruling	This command lets you query the Cheer/Jeer tables and roll random Cheer/Jeer effects! (You can also use `{cp}cheer` and `{cp}jeer` as shortcuts.) Type `{cp}audience help` for more details!
cheer		Rollers	FALSE	cheerruling	This command lets you query the Cheer tables and roll random Cheer effects! Type `{cp}cheer help` for more details!
jeer		Rollers	FALSE	jeerruling	This command lets you query the Jeer tables and roll random Jeer effects! Type `{cp}jeer help` for more details!
goallock	goallocks	Reminders (Liberation)	FALSE		__**GoalLocks**__ look like sports goals, labelled to show who owns them. They give the owner a point when something specific is put inside (e.g. a ball; a Mettaur; a cake.) If a room has only one GoalLock, it gives a point to whoever makes the goal. When the alarm triggers, the team with the most points wins.
teamlock	teamlocks	Reminders (Liberation)	FALSE		__**TeamLocks**__ look like pressure plates, buttons, and other simple devices. TeamLocks only appear in team matches. If teams have X number of players, a tile has X number of TeamLocks. All of them must be activated simultaneously by Close Navis in order to work. The first team to work the TeamLock wins.
crownlock	crownlocks	Reminders (Liberation)	FALSE		__**CrownLocks**__ look like large, fancy headware. Once a Navi puts it on, it shines bright. When the Navi would cause the tile’s Countdown to lower by 1, they instead gain a point. Removing the crown does not reset points. When a Navi reaches 3 points, the CrownLock activates and the Navi wins.
					
daemon		Lookups	FALSE	daemonruling	This command looks up a Daemon's information for DarkChip rules. For additional details on DarkChip rules (i.e. DarkChip limits, Tributes, ChaosUnisons, and Daemon Bonds), try checking `{cp}help`! (i.e. `{cp}help darkchips`) 
darkchip	darkchips, signaturedarkchip, signaturedarkchips	Reminders (DarkChips)	FALSE		**__DarkChips__** are destructive BattleChips connected to an outside entity - a **Daemon**. When a Navi first comes into contact with a DarkChip, even if they don’t use it, a Daemon will gain a tenuous link. If the Navi ignores the Daemon's temptations for long enough, the link will fade. However, using a DarkChip creates a Bond with the Daemon instead.\n\nWhenever a Navi uses a DarkChip, they have a choice - either **increase their Daemon Bond by 1** or perform their **Tribute**.\n\nDarkChips can only be used **once** each. **DarkChips have the same restrictions as MegaChips.** However, when a Daemon puts a DarkChip in a Navi’s Folder, it ignores all Folder restrictions.\n\n**Signature DarkChips** can only be accessed by that Daemon.
tribute	tributes, daemontribute, daemontributes	Reminders (DarkChips)	FALSE		**__Tributes__** are destructive acts that temporarily sacrifice a Navi’s agency, letting the Daemon act through them. Tributes have long-lasting consequences that persist on jack-out.\n\nThe primary way to Tribute is by using a DarkChip and choosing to Tribute instead of increasing your Daemon Bond by 1. However, once the Navi has a **Bond Level 3** or higher with the Daemon, the Daemon can remotely trigger their Tribute. It won’t happen instantaneously - there will be warning signs, such as a creeping feeling, icy hands, or uncontrollable shivers. When a Daemon triggers a Tribute, it is almost certain to happen at the worst possible time.
chaosunison	chaosunisons, chaosunion, chaosunions	Reminders (DarkChips)	FALSE		**__ChaosUnisons__** are corruptions of the Bond Power CrossSoul. When a Navi with a Daemon Bond activates CrossSoul, instead of spending 3 Bond Points, they can **sacrifice a DarkChip to trigger a ChaosUnison**. ChaosUnisons still Cross with an ally and contain all the benefits of a CrossSoul, but with three additional effects:\n>>> 1. Gain the Daemon's ChaosUnison benefit.\n2. CrossSoul instead lasts for **2+[Daemon Bond Leve]x2** rolls.\n3. The Navi increases their Daemon Bond Level by 1 after it ends.
domain	domains, daemondomain, daemondomains	Reminders (DarkChips)	FALSE		**__Domains__** represent the feelings the Daemon preys on and what benefits it offers. Domains influence the kinds of DarkChips Daemons provide, how they influence NetOps and Navis, and its Tribute.
daemonbond	daemonbonds	Reminders (DarkChips)	FALSE		Each __**Daemon Bond**__ Level a NetOp gains with a Daemon increases the influence the Daemon has over the Navi, with increasingly severe effects. Unlike normal Bonds, **Daemon Bonds can exceed 3**. Bond Points from Daemons can be used for normal Bond Powers. However, Navis cannot CrossSoul with Daemons.\n\nWhen a player character has a Daemon Bond, they gain an extra step to Growing Up: **Subvert your Daemon’s desire**. Completing this step can take the place of one of the other three steps. When a player character completes three Growing Up steps including “Subvert your Daemon’s desire,” **the Daemon Bond Level is reduced by one**.\n\nUse `>help daemonbondex` to see the full list of Daemon Bond effects. Unless stated otherwise, the effect of each Bond Level stacks with the following levels.
daemonbondex	daemonbondexamples, daemonbondlist, daemonbonddetails, daemonbonddetail	Reminders (DarkChips)	TRUE		**Bond Level 1:** The Daemon can freely communicate with the NetOp and Navi via the PET, using whatever form or voice they choose.\n**Bond Level 2:** When the Navi rolls partial successes during ChaosUnison, the Daemon can choose to turn them into failures or full successes. The Daemon can also subtly manipulate the NetOp’s PET.\n**Bond Level 3:** The Daemon can remotely trigger a Tribute for any reason, or no reason at all.\n**Bond Level 4:** When the Navi uses a DarkChip, the NetOp must make an Easy Affinity roll to prevent the Daemon from taking control of the Navi.\n**Bond Level 5:** The Navi can ChaosUnison directly with the Daemon, adding 4 to every skill. DarkChip use now requires a Normal NetOp Affinity roll to prevent the Daemon from controlling the Navi.\n**Bond Level 6+:** The NetOp must make a Hard Affinity roll on jack-out, DarkChip use, and when a target is deleted. Failing this roll means the Daemon assumes total control of the Navi, likely permanently.
					
netrace	netracing, leg, legs	Reminders (Advanced Content)	FALSE		During a __**NetRace**__, each Navi's vehicle uses their stats & skills, and anything that affects the vehicle also affects the Navi. Each racer also tracks their **__Velocity__**, which starts at 3 and measures their relative position to other racers. (Close: 0-2 Velocity difference; Near: 3-5 Velocity difference; Far: 6+ Velocity difference)\n\nChips/powers that move you a range band give +/-2 Velocity, and cannot move 2 range bands. When damaged, racers can reduce either HP or Velocity. Velocity cannot go below 0. The racer that completes the final leg with the highest Velocity wins the race.\n\n Each leg follows the flowchart below:\n>>> 1. GM describes the leg and its difficulty.\n2. Players can spend 1 Velocity to roll or use a chip/power. Navi Powers can only be used once per race.\n3. Racers roll to tackle the leg, rolling at the same time and adding the number of hits to their velocity. Racers can only use each skill to overcome a leg once per race.
mod	networkmod	Lookups	FALSE	networkmodruling	This command looks up a Network Modifier.
networkmodifier	networkmodifiers, networkmods	Reminders (Advanced Content)	TRUE	networkmodruling	
divergence	diverge	Reminders (Advanced Content)	FALSE		As living, feeling beings, Navis can rewrite their own code by **__Diverging__**, redefining their identity as they develop a sense of self. This can change their element, name, pronouns, appearance, stat/skill allocation, and more.\nDivergence has three steps: \n\n> **1. Foundation:** A history of feelings that leave room for future Divergence (i.e. a repressed, consistent negative reaction; a discomfort assumed to be shared by everyone; setbacks internalized as unavoidable/unsurpassable). Foundations do not need to happen on-camera, nor do they need to be dramatic, traumatic, or tragic.\n\n> **2. Catalyst:** An event (or series of events) that crystalizes the need to change (i.e. a hard-fought netbattle, deep one-on-one conversations, gradually connecting with someone who's also changed). Catalysts should not create immediate change; they create a turning point in which the Navi starts to actively pursue their own Divergence. Players should collaborate with their GM to get what they want out of the Catalyst. \n\n> **3. Divergence:** Once the Navi has found their Catalyst and spent enough time processing and exploring their revelation, they can find a calm, private place and Diverge. Players and GMs should work closely together on how the Divergence manifests. The player has total narrative control over how it looks and feels. If the Navi's NetOp helped them through the process, they complete an extra step to Growing Up: Diverging, which can take the place of one of the other three steps.
upgrade	npu	Lookups	FALSE	npuruling	This command looks up all upgrades for a default Navi Power! You can also use `{cp}npu` to call this command.
megavirus	megaviruses	Reminders (Advanced Content)	FALSE		__**Mega Viruses**__ are Viruses with stronger abilities and more complicated powers. Due to their complex programming, Mega Viruses are **not affected** by anything that only works on Viruses (i.e. Overwrite NCP, Recall chip, certain Virus powers).\n\nAdditionally, some Mega Viruses may be controlled by **signal nodes**: powerful code clusters that issue commands from afar. Some signal nodes can be destroyed, some can be hacked, and others can simply be waited out until the node can't power the MegaVirus anymore. Once a signal node is overcome, it grants all of the Mega Virus's BattleChip drops.
signalnode	signalnodes, controlnode, controlnodes	Reminders (Advanced Content)	FALSE		__**Signal Nodes**__ are powerful code clusters housed in well-protected (or well-hidden) structures that issue commands to Mega Viruses from afar. Some signal nodes can be destroyed, some can be hacked, and others can simply be waited out until the node can't power the MegaVirus anymore.\n\nOnce a signal node is overcome, it grants all of the Mega Virus's chip drops.
omegavirus	omegaviruses, omega	Reminders (Advanced Content)	FALSE		__**Omega Viruses**__ are the Omega versions of Mega Viruses and are even stronger than their original form: they can have higher stats/skills, improved Powers, and extra abilities.\n\nThe same rules and restrictions for Mega Viruses apply:  Omega Viruses are **not affected** by anything that only works on Viruses, and some may be controlled by **signal nodes** from afar.\n\nAll Omega Viruses drop their **MegaChip** when overcome (unless explicitly stated otherwise) - no roll necessary.
					
ncpruling		Reminders (Base)	TRUE		__**Navi Customizer Programs**__ (NCPs) are installable software NetOps can use to modify their Navi! They can give various perks like increasing folder size, granting access to special Navi powers, and more!\n**Check with your GM to see how many EB (Exabytes) your character starts with!**
bondruling		Reminders (Base)	TRUE		**Bonds** are forged between NetOps and can be used for powerful **Bond Powers**! Bond Levels cannot exceed 3 and are shared. You can increase your Bond Level with someone in three ways (you can use each method once per player character):\n> • Teaching them a meaningful lesson \n > • Sacrificing something dear to you for them \n > • Reaching the end of a narrative arc with them \n\nBond Points can be spent on Bond Powers. Spend time off with a NetOp to get Bond Points equal to your Bond Level with them. (You cannot have more Bond Points than all of your Bond Levels combined.) When using a Bond Power, make sure to describe how you use your Bond with your allies! **Nothing can dispel or mitigate a Bond Power's effects.**
chipruling		Reminders (Base)	TRUE		__**BattleChips**__ are one-use attacks that NetOps slot into their PETs. When a NetOp slots in a BattleChip, it is used immediately unless otherwise listed. Many BattleChips have **secondary effects**, like stunning or reducing one of the target’s skills. To resist these, the target must roll more hits than the chip’s damage. (If the chip deals no damage, the target must roll a success to resist the BattleChip.)\nYour PET's folder space is determined by your **Navi Mind + Navi Info + 2**.\nWhen making a new character, pick starter BattleChips equal to your **NetOp Mind + NetOp Info + 2**.\n\nAfter a Navi uses a BattleChip, they need to jack out to make that BattleChip usable again, or to change their Folder. **By default, Folders may not have duplicate BattleChips or more than 1 MegaChip, unless explictly stated otherwise.**
virusruling		Reminders (Base)	TRUE		__**Viruses**__ are programs with simple, animal-like intelligences that wreak havoc across the internet. Viruses frequently work together, synergizing with different Virus types to make formidable threats. Depending on their purpose, they may modify their environment to set up traps, entrench themselves, or simply to cause as much destruction as possible.\n\nEach Virus has a general **Category**, which helps describe their type (i.e. Artillery Viruses firing long-range blasts), while some may have **Tags** which indicate special common properties (i.e. Hovering). Viruses use Powers just like Navis, and many have special, custom abilities!\n\n**All Viruses have data within them that can be downloaded upon deletion.** Check out `{cp}help download` for more detail!
elementruling		Reminders (Base)	TRUE		When Navis roll Affinity, they can summon or manipulate their **__element__**. Player Navis can only summon and manipulate tangible manifestations of their element. This means emotions, sensations, or abstract concepts (i.e. Luck or Chaos) cannot be directly summoned or manipulated. However, summoned objects may be able to manipulate abstract ideas (i.e. using a summoned clock to slow time). In general, using your element becomes more difficult at greater quantities or distances.\n\nBroadly-defined elements have a harder time performing specific actions. Powerful elements should have limitations or drawbacks. Unless using the Navi Power Control, damaging Elements are Hazards. Without GM assent, elements only act as defined above. \n\n**NPCs and enemies, especially bosses, may ignore these restrictions.** Enemy elements may be overpowering or have special mechanics tied to them. Make sure to find ways to overcome the enemy's element!
npuruling		Reminders (Advanced Content)	TRUE		__**Navi Power Upgrades**__ (NPUs) are NCPs that can be used to upgrade Navi Powers. All NPUs require the original Navi Power, either from character creation or a NaviCust Program. **You can only have one Navi Power Upgrade installed for each Navi Power.**\nBenefits from Navi Power Upgrades are lost if either the Upgrade or the Navi Power itself are uninstalled. Anything that copies Navi Powers (e.g. NaviChips) also copies NPUs.
powerruling		Reminders (Base)	TRUE		All Navis have __**Navi Powers**__: special abilities they can use at any time. There are two types of powers:\n> ◊ **Cost Powers** reduce the relevant skill by one to use them, no roll required. Cost Powers cannot be used if the skill is 0.\n > • **Roll Powers** roll the relevant skill to use the power.\n\nTargets can defend against Navi Powers that directly impede them (e.g. Disruption; not Analyze). Cost Powers that only modify the user’s attack (e.g. BreakCharge) take no time to activate; other Cost Powers may be quick to activate as well, depending on the power and situation.
audienceruling		Reminders (Advanced Content)	TRUE		When a session has **__Audience Participation__**, the audience is given two resources: **Cheer Points** and **Jeer Points**. \n**Cheer Points:** When players rolls anything but a failure, they can downgrade the result of their roll to give the audience Cheer Points (+2 points per downgraded level). \n**Jeer Points:** The GM can give Jeer Points as the downside to a player's partial success or failure (2 points for partial, 4 points for failure). \n\nAudience members can spend Cheer and Jeer points at any time. If the effect can't manifest now, it will appear at the next opportunity. For larger audiences, consider limiting who can spend Cheer/Jeer points and how often! \n> **1 Point:** Roll a random effect on the Cheer/Jeer table.\n > **2 Points:** Pick a specific effect from the Cheer/Jeer table.\n > **5 Points:** Pick a specific effect from the MegaCheer/MegaJeer table! 
cheerruling		Reminders (Advanced Content)	TRUE		When a session has **__Audience Participation__**, the audience is given **Cheer Points**, which they can use to grant players bonuses and benefits! When players rolls anything but a failure, they can downgrade the result of their roll to give the audience Cheer Points (+2 points per downgraded level). \n\nAudience members can spend Cheer points at any time. If the effect can't manifest now, it will appear at the next opportunity. For larger audiences, consider limiting who can spend Cheer points and how often! \n> **1 Point:** Roll a random effect on the Cheer table.\n > **2 Points:** Pick a specific effect from the Cheer table.\n > **5 Points:** Pick a specific effect from the MegaCheer table! 
jeerruling		Reminders (Advanced Content)	TRUE		When a session has **__Audience Participation__**, the audience is given **Jeer Points**, which they can use to boost enemies and trip up players! The GM can give Jeer Points as the downside to a player's partial success or failure (2 points for partial, 4 points for failure). \n\nAudience members can spend Jeer points at any time. If the effect can't manifest now, it will appear at the next opportunity. For larger audiences, consider limiting who can spend Cheer/Jeer points and how often! \n> **1 Point:** Roll a random effect on the Jeer table.\n > **2 Points:** Pick a specific effect from the Jeer table.\n > **5 Points:** Pick a specific effect from the MegaJeer table! 
networkmodruling		Reminders (Advanced Content)	TRUE		__**Network Modifiers**__ (Network Mods) are overarching rules applied to an entire network. Network Mods are often installed somewhere onto the server, either housed digitally as a huge structure or physically inserted into the server itself. 
daemonruling		Reminders (DarkChips)	TRUE		__**Daemons**__ are the entities responsible for **DarkChips**. Mysterious beings with inestimatable powers, they prey on insecurities to forge dark bonds with Navis.\n\nDaemons have four aspects: their **Domain**, **Tribute**, **ChaosUnison**, and **Signature DarkChip**. Within their Domain, their powers are myriad and far-reaching: spawning Viruses, corrupting Mystery Data, and haunting NPCs are just some of the ways they can exert their influence. And while they are responsible for DarkChips, they can tempt Navis in other, crueller ways so long as it aligns with their Domain, all in exchange for a Bond Point or Tribute.

grid	grid-basedcombat, gridbased, gridbasedcombat, grids	Helpers	TRUE		**Setup**\nWhen combat begins, assemble a grid map to illustrate the environment. A small arena may have a length and width of 10 by 10 tiles, but most should by at least 24 by 24, with an average height of at least 12 tiles.\nMost Navis are 2 tiles tall, 1 tile long, and 1 tile wide. Most Viruses are 1x1x1. The GM decides when things fit outside those parameters.\n\n**Range Bands and Movement**\nJust like outside of grid-based combat, range bands are measured relative to two things. To measure the distance between two entities, suspend a piece of string between them, draw it taut, then cut the string. If the segment measuring the distance between the two entities is under 3 inches, they are Close. If it is between 3 and 12 inches (inclusive), they are Near. Anything past that is Far.\nMoving range bands works the same way, except the string should follow the projected trajectory. Therefore, the string must include enough slack to account for arcs inherent in actions like jumping.

grid	grid-basedcombat, gridbased, gridbasedcombat, grids	Helpers	TRUE		Okay, #general-netbattlers, I need your help with this. This is not a help text, this is a long read, but I feel like my safety or well-being could very well depend on this. This is NetBattlers related, specifically grid-based combat, and this is the creepiest shit that has ever happened to me in my entire life.\n\nHaving said that, I recently moved into my dorm room starting as a Sophomore in college and a friend of mine gave me his old dice set & a hand-printed copy of World of Dungeons. I was stoked, to say the least, I could finally play TTRPGs IRL with my friends and not have to use one of those dice roller apps. His copy of WoD came with a partially-filled character sheet and some loose GM notes, and while beggars can't be choosers, needless to say it didn't take long until I wanted to run something different.\n\nThat weekend I decided to drive around a few neighborhoods about twenty minutes or so off campus, hitting up the local garage sales, hoping to score on some good deals from ignorant parents). I ended up picking up a copy of ODnD, Tenra Bansho Zero (fuck yeah), Ryuutama, and two other books for twenty dollars. Satisfied, I began to drive out of the neighborhood when one last house caught my attention. I still have no idea why it did, there were no cars there and only one table was set up with random junk on it, but something sort of drew me there. I usually trust my gut on these things so I got out of the car and I was greeted by an old man. His outward appearance was, for lack of a better word, displeasing. It was odd, if you asked me to tell you why I thought he was displeasing, I couldn't really pinpoint anything - there was just something about him that put me on edge, I can't explain it. All I can tell you is that if it wasn't in the middle of the afternoon and there were other people within shouting distance, I would not have even thought of approaching this man.
grid	grid-basedcombat, gridbased, gridbasedcombat, grids	Helpers	TRUE		He flashed a crooked smiled at me and asked what I was looking for, and immediately I noticed that he must be blind in one of his eyes; his right eye had that "glazed over" look about it. I forced myself to look to his left eye instead, trying not to offend, and asked him if he had any old roleplaying books.\n\nI was already wondering how I could politely excuse myself from the situation when he would tell me he had no idea what a roleplaying game was, but to my surprise he said he had a few ones in an old box. He assured me he'd be back in a "jiffy" and turned to head back into the garage. As I watched him hobble away, I couldn't help but notice what he was selling on his table. Littered across his table were rather… peculiar paintings; various artworks that looked like ink blots that a psychiatrist might show you. Curious, I looked through them - it was obvious why no one was visiting this guy's garage sale, these weren't exactly aesthetically pleasing. As I came to the last one, for some reason it looked almost like a mettaur - the same little yellow helmet with two big eyes poking out from underneath. Initially I just thought that since I was secretly hoping to find that game at these garage sales, some Freudian bullshit was projecting itself into the ink blots, but given the events that happened afterward I'm not so sure now. I should have asked the man about it. I wish I would have asked the man about it.\n\nAfter staring at the mettaur-shaped blot, I looked up and the old man was suddenly there again, arms-length in front of me, smiling at me. I'll admit I jumped out of reflex and I laughed nervously as he handed me a printout of "NetBattlers". Even though it was clearly printed by hand, the cover looked awesome. I got butterflies in my stomach as I realized what a coincidence this was and asked him how much he wanted for it.
grid	grid-basedcombat, gridbased, gridbasedcombat, grids	Helpers	TRUE		The old man smiled at me and told me that I could have it for free, that it used to belong to a kid who was about my age that didn't live here anymore. There was something weird about how the man phrased that, but I didn't really pay any attention to then, I was too caught up in not only finding this game but getting it for free.\n\nI reminded myself to be a bit skeptical since this looked like a pretty shady printout and there's no guarantee it would work, but then the optimist inside me interjected that maybe it was some kind of beta version or pirated version of the game and that was all I needed to be back on cloud nine. I thanked the man and the man smiled at me and wished me well, saying "Well, goodbye!" - at least that's what it sounded like to me. All the way in the car-ride home, I had a nagging doubt that the man had said something else. My fears were confirmed when I found some character sheets in the back of the book and there was one player named simply "Will". "Will, goodbye", he was saying "Will, goodbye". I felt bad for the man, obviously a grandparent and obviously going senile, and I - for some reason or another - reminded him of his grandchild "Will".\n\nOut of curiosity I looked at the character sheet. Eyeballing it, I could tell that they were pretty far into their campaign - they had 8 EB and over a dozen chips. I noticed that they had max bonds with three other players, with personal notes about how they wanted their character's prologue to end. I remember thinking that it was a shame that they had come so close to finishing a campaign. I drafted up a new character named "Raffi" and started the game, ready to relive my childhood.
