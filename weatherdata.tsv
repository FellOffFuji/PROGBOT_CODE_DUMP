Name	Category	Description
DiamondDust	Basic	Shiny particles hover in the air, giving the server a glittery, glamorous air. Primarily meant for fashion runways, the dust’s flammability issues have yet to be patched out.
Prismist	Basic	Simple mist, fog, rain, or snow with a shining rainbow aura. Thinking positive thoughts cause it to shine brighter.
SpringBreeze	Basic	A warm, refreshing breeze rolls through the server. It makes plants blossom and gravity half as strong as normal.
SummerSun	Basic	Code trained on summer vacation movies. Bright, warm sunbeams illuminate the server, and a picturesque beach materializes at the server’s edge (or a nearby open space).
8-BallNebula	Glitched	Blue-black rain falls from a nebulous sky. Any that drink a glass’s worth can ask the sky a question — any question — and get an answer in the form of a cryptic, dreamlike vision.
ChromaticFlux	Glitched	Intense action can scramble the server’s palette, recasting everything in dramatic hues. It eventually normalizes, but rapid, repeated fluxes can cause permanent recoloration.
GlitchDischarge	Glitched	Buggy clouds accumulate. Anyone wet, glitched, or really unlucky may be struck by bug thunder (a Normal hazard). Fully resisting it grants Element: Bug Thunder for 5 rolls.
MementoBorealis	Glitched	Lights dance across the sky. If a Navi focuses on a memory, the lights depict that memory the lights depict that memory.
ResonantWaves	Glitched	Unusual airwaves cause the server to gently undulate. Its contents rise and fall as if floating on a stormy sea.
StaticSnow	Glitched	Flickering snow drifts from above and accumulates. The more snow has amassed, the worse PET connections get.
GraveyardFog	Error	Ghosts of dead Navis appear. Most are incorporeal and don’t notice the living. (Most.) Illusory structures randomly appear and vanish. Nobody knows what’s inside them.
LiquidTime	Error	The server’s timekeeping functions melt, drip, and rain, breaking the linear flow of time. Time may accelerate, slow, stop, or reverse. This may not affect the server uniformly.
MeteorShowers	Error	At first, they seem like radiant shooting stars... until they get closer. Meteors are slow to impact the server, but they cause devastating damage. Each one is an Extreme hazard.
Scalewind	Error	A glimmering, uneasy wind slowly twists through the server. Shortly after, objects and individuals randomly shrink and grow, sometimes rapidly.
