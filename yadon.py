#Yadon keeps track of tables, which are stored in text files... it's slow, like Yadon...
#- "Keep it simple stupid"
#- Useful as a quick and dirty way to store data on drive if efficiency is not important
#- Keys and values are all strings
#- Each row is made up of the key followed by the row values, all separated by tabs
#- Tables are edited by simply rewriting the text file
#- Keep backups of tables in case writing fails for whatever reason!
#- When manually editing the text files, make sure the last line is empty (line break) so that appending will work properly
